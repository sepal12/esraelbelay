# Hi there, I'm Esrael Belay! 👋

## About Me 🚀

I am currently a student enrolled in a front-end web development course @alx_africa, where I’m building my skills in creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites. I am focusing on crafting clean, responsive, and creative designs that enhance the web experience for users. My goal is to become a skilled front-end developer, contribute to innovative projects, and continuously grow in the tech industry. I aspire to turn my passion for coding into a meaningful career that inspires others.
